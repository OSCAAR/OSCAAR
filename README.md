**If you're new to oscaar, we strongly recommend that you check out our [prettier and more detailed GitPage](http://oscaar.github.io) rather than reading this little README.**

OSCAAR supports Mac OS 10.6 and above, Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows. It requires Python 2.7 and several additional packages listed on our [Dependencies wiki page](https://github.com/OSCAAR/OSCAAR/wiki/Dependencies).

OSCAAR 2.0 is under active development. Code will change and break rapidly and without notice. We welcome your input and suggestions as we develop new features. Please submit them through the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OSCAAR/OSCAAR/issues) (click "New Issue" in the top right, and enter your suggestions).
